# Additional Information

- **Notes**
	- Nine faces are included with the model and are in the SVG format. Each layer is a facial feature of a single color. This can be cut by hand or more accurately on a machine like the [Cricut](https://cricut.com/en_us). Alternatively, you can print and cut `lise-face.pdf` for each facial expression.
